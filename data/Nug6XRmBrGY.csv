644(9),2022-12-28T21:10:01Z,V S,"@Shiv Dewan Well, it is not my theory but research done in the field of 'Languages, Accents and Pronunciations'. 
I had shared the link to it above and it would have been nice to read them before commenting. However, as reading and building knowledge always takes time and effort so, I can understand if you want to over write the research based on your own preconceived notions and beliefs. 
Also, your own example can't be used in the current scope of discussion because you were raised in USA as you said but born to Indian family. You were exposed to the tones, accents of which ever regional language your parents or family speaks at a much tender age and that would have helped you to have a more balanced accent. But that is not the case in majority of the Indian families where most of the interaction happens in regional languages and English is either spoken in schools/colleges/friends circle. People develop their English accent that has impressions of their specific cultural, regional and social marking. Further to this they are raised in that set-up for a substantial phase of their impressionable age until 18-20 years. One can't go to a foreign country and start speaking in say native Irish accent, it just doesn't work like that. 
All these use-cases and complexities are explained in the paper that was shared. So, do yourself some favour and read it. It further describes the more nuanced layer of people moving from developing nations to developed nations have more of this urge to put accents and find acceptance than people moving from a developed nation to another developed nation. These are topics of big research and you generalising with your own use case without even thinking hard shows complete lack of depth.
You are a prime example of not reading things fully and generalising nuanced discussions and not even stepping back and using some common sense thinking why your case is different. If you would have done that you would have instantly figured out that your case is aligned more with kids born to NRIs who had exposure to native regional Indian languages spoken at home along with local English accents of your country of birth and that too at a very early ages of your lives which enables you to switch accents when speaking different languages.",0,0

Obviously I speak with an American accent because I was born and raised here, but when I visit India, I nearly always return with a slightly Indian tinge to my accent that I don’t even notice until it is pointed out based on my vocal inflections, pronunciations of certain words, etc. In other words, your theory of “insecurity” would have to hold true both ways. Alternative, simpler theory: people naturally adjust their speech to  match those around them, both to fit in AND to make those around them more comfortable.",2,0

The accent in discussion is the accent of a foreign country where the person is not born and has only lived for a brief period. I am born in India and have lived half of my life in India and the other half in Europe. Of course, I have accent but that is more native to my country of origin i.e.specific region of India. I can't start speaking in Scottish accent if I move to Scotland just for a period of 1 year but have lived all my 30 years of adult life in India. Obviously, accent has markings of culture, regional language and other factors, no one is disputing it.

I have lived  in NA for 5 plus years and whenever I go to Ind I’ve never heard anyone pointing out my accent. I always talk in my Indian accent. However, after 4 years my gf pointed out that I have an accent when I talk to Americans. I never realised it, but started noticing that. I noticed the same with other Indian friends of mine who usually just talk in their regular Indian accent when they are with fellow Indians or people from subcontinent. And again most ppl don’t realise this themselves.

So, please do yourself some favour and read the research before you come here and start making uninformed statements and trivialising the debate.

It has been proven that people change their accents either to have more social acceptance or at times due to the demands of their profession. In the latter case, it was deemed to be acceptable because in certain use-cases like if someone is a Teacher from a non-native English speaking country but teaching in English speaking country it enables them to be able to teach more effectively or an actor changing an accent for a character. However, in majority of the cases it was hypothesised people tried to change accents to find more acceptance. It was also postulated it raises questions of credibility and in the experiment people found it more difficult to trust people putting a fake accent than people who spoke naturally. Coming here and making every argument about morality is a bit stupid and shows lack of both knowledge and experience. Being judged and judging others is the way humans and mind is wired and we are trained to do so since we have evolved to our present selves. I leave it for you to do some reading about that as well so, next time you can make more factual based arguments rather than philosophical arguments.
Also, your statement:
It is only a certain set of NRI indians with a superiority complex who put down and ridicule other indians just because they chose to speak in a native accent. ---> Are you talking about yourself here? And by your own yardstick are you not judging other now? 
Because my point was exactly the same  to rather stick to your native accent than putting on a fake accent. Also, putting a fake accent is such an outdated concept where we are both forcing and encouraging people to change themselves rather than to embrace themselves.",12,0
644(37),2022-09-29T11:53:01Z,Shreyaaa,"@V S you are bringing them down, it is an opinion that is farce, judgemental. So it is not a good opinion at all. So i was just pointing that out. 

Why would you correlate speaking in a native English accent to ""they're ashamed of their roots/have a complex"" How do you even come to that conclusion? 

When I see French, korean, Nigerian people speaking in an American english accent instead of their native one, thinking that they must be ashamed of who they are is the last thing that comes to my mind. It is only a certain set of NRI indians with a superiority complex who put down and ridicule other indians just because they chose to speak in a native accent. 

It is simply a fact that the native accents of any other language sound better, I'd much rather have a foreigner try to sound like a native hindi/marwari/punjabi speaker than mix their language sounds in it.
 People in the Western countries or other Asian countries are probably not as judgemental so as to think someone must be ashamed of their damn culture because they're trying to sound like a native English speaker🥴

People in the western countries are not foolish, they can too understand when one is trying hard and putting a fake accent vs when someone is speaking with the natural accent. Moreover, if one thinks speaking with accent will get you acceptance then its a big mistake because people who want to accept you will do so, irrespective of your accent and the ones who want to discriminate will find another parameter (like say, colour) to discriminate no matter how much accent you put. The point is if one is ashamed of their roots the acceptance has to first start within himself/herself. Seeking validation from outside world by putting a fake accent is a never ending journey.",21,0

So now that I have explained it, does that mean it is racist since you said if I can't explain it then it's prolly not? Like I only parroted exactly what was in the short, nothing else happened, it's like a video of a person that stood up and sat on a chair and me typing ""that person stood up and sat on a chair"" like why were you so adament with me typing out everything that happened in the video when I already told you and you can see that that is the only thing happened in it, that's why I used the word ""obvious"" to highlight or emphasize that that's all that happened and they talked about nothing else, like if there was a 2 second long extra scene for filler or bts, then at least I would be like ""no no the first part where..."" this an that but come on, nothing else is there but the reason why I questioned if the joke was what I think it was, not because I think that's whay the joke is but because I don't know and want to know because that is literally all I see, maybe if I get the joke then at least I'll go ""ohhh..."" but now my suspicion of you being a racist is the only thing that's rising and it's frustrating for the third time because I don't careee.
